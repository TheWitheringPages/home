            Before the <span class="glitch">silence</span>, there were four. Before the <span class="glitch">withering</span>, there was StarClan. We hunted, we fought, we lived by a code passed down through <span class="glitch">generations.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Moons rose and fell, kits were born, and elders told their stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            But <span class="glitch">something</span> was listening. Something was waiting. The <span class="glitch">whispers</span> started at the edge of hearing, a promise in exchange for... what? We did not listen.

            <span class="glitch">We should have.</span>

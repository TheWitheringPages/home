                    <p>BrackenClan is intelligent, brave, grounded, preferring to thrive in the secrecy of their densely forested territory. They excel at stalking, tracking, and ambushing during hunts, relying more on their environment than on brute strength or speed.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">The medicine cats of BrackenClan are deeply in tune with the forest around them and often interpret the growth of fungi and the behavior of crows as omens from StarClan. It is customary for medicine cats to bring offerings of shiny objects to Lichen Grove for the crows.</p>

                    <p class="text-center mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">Brackenclan camp is situated in the heart of their territory within an ancient forest. It is slightly sunken into the ground, forming a natural basin encircled by roots, dense brambles, and lush foliage. The camp is cleverly constructed to remain hidden and difficult to find.</p>
                    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-6">
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Main Entrance:</strong> A narrow tunnel through thick bracken and thorny ferns, wide enough for only one cat to pass through at a time.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Leader's Den:</strong> A spacious, hollowed-out cedar stump at the edge of the camp, overgrown with moss and lichens. The leader often addresses the clan from atop this stump.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Warriors' Den:</strong> Nestled beneath massive hemlocks, with drooping branches acting as natural curtains. Nests are made of soft moss, leaves, and bracken.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Apprentices' Den:</strong> A cozy depression on the western slope of the camp, padded with fallen fern fronds and sheltered by arching roots.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Medicine Cat Den:</strong> Tucked against the far wall of the camp in a shallow cave, featuring naturally carved shelves for herbs.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Nursery:</strong> Located beneath the intertwined roots of two ancient trees, creating a dome-shaped shelter insulated with brambles and moss.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Elders' Den:</strong> An old, sunken tree trunk lined with soft bark and moss at the edge of the camp.</p>

                        <p><strong class="text-white">Lichen Grove:</strong> An eerie glade filled with tall trees draped heavily in moss and lichen, creating a curtain-like effect. A sacred location for interpreting omens.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Echoing Meadow:</strong> A serene resting place for former clan members, surrounded by dense ferns. Some say that on foggy days, you can catch glimpses of small shadows moving across the clearing.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Softstep Pine:</strong> A section of territory filled with dense pine trees, where the forest floor is carpeted with sound-muffling pine needles.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Nettle Warren:</strong> A dense, tangled thicket of bramble and bracken, challenging to navigate but rich with small prey.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Old Twoleg Nest:</strong> A long-abandoned wooden nest in the southernmost part of the territory, home to mice and rats.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Still Pool:</strong> A tranquil, still pond deep within the territory. Elders share rumors that it reflects signs of impending danger.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Foxtail Thicket:</strong> A dense forested area home to mushrooms and fungi. Named for a fox that once made its den here, a tale told to frighten young cats.</p>
                        <p><strong class="text-white">Endless Lake:</strong> A large pond marking the end of the Timeless Torrent and part of the tense border with Mistclan.</p>

        <p>
            It does not kill fast. It changes. It begins with a cough, a fever, a thirst that water cannot quench. The eyes change first. Then the hunger. Not for prey, but for <span class="redacted">something else entirely</span>. The connection to StarClan is severed. In its place, a new voice whispers. It promises strength. It promises an end to <span class="redacted">suffering.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The afflicted are faster, stronger, at least for a period. Their pelts become dull, their scent wrong. They no longer feel pain, or fear, or loyalty. They are merely vessels for the <span class="redacted">entities</span>. The only prevention is <span class="redacted">the pink sauce</span>, a concoction from a fallen <span class ="redacted">entity</span>.
